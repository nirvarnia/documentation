# Introduction

Nirvarnia is a collection of beautifully crafted JavaScript and CSS libraries and scaffolding for websites and webapps.

The libraries are loosely coupled and can be used independently of one another. But put them together and you've got a comprehensive framework and design system for client-side "single page" web applications.

Nirvarnia was developed to serve as the user interface design system for a SaaS product. The primary objective was to enable us to rapidly compose high quality user experiences across multiple web properties, drawing from a central library of common GUI components. We've shared our work for the benefit of the wider open source software ecosystem.

Like all application frameworks, Nirvarnia is opinionated. It speeds up the development of web applications by taking away decisions on architectural design, codifying best practices, and enforcing constraints on application code. For example, Nirvarnia imposes the proper underlining of hyperlinks and the outlining of focused elements to achieve high standards of accessibility.
